\section{Cloud Computing}

There are many definitions describing the term "Cloud Computing". The American National Institute of Standards and Technology provide their own, accepted definition:
“Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” \citep{mell2009}

As described by \citet{vaquero2009} Cloud Computing can be distinguished into three different categories of services. Two services are used in this project and described in the following.


\paragraph{Infrastructure as a Service}~\\
A huge range of resources like storing and processing capacity is controlled by providers. By the use of virtualisation they distribute their resources to customers and can change the assigned resources quickly. Customers can use these resources very flexible, they usually use their own software stack. 

\paragraph{Platform as a Service}~\\Provider can create an additional layer upon their infrastructure. They use a small software stack and an execution environment to provide a software platform. Hardware resources are transparent for the customer and should be adjusted for the current resource consumption.
