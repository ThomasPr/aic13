\section{Discussion / Conclusion}

When it comes to a comparison between the Amazon EC2 and the Google App Engine it has to be noted that they offer different services. The Google App Engine as a Platform as a Service provider requires some customisations to fit an Application to its infrastructure, but offers a very fast initial deployment. There is no huge own knowledge required to deploy an application.

In contrast to the AWS EC2: It offers much more flexibility, because it doesn't offer any services and therefore it doesn't require customisations. But the customer has to handle many technologies by himself.

Recapitulating, for this project Amazon EC2 fits better to the requirements than Google App Engine. The most crucial point for this decision is the very expensive write operations to the data store as well as the lack of many JPA features.
